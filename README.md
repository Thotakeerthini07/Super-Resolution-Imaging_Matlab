 Super-Resolution Imaging

To prevent motion artifacts, capturing satellite images is usually done at rates lower than the nominal sampling rate, which results in low-resolution images. Using super- resolution methods, high-resolution images can be reconstructed from these low- resolution ones. Due to the importance of this issue, this task is focused on the super- resolution problem. The aim is to obtain high-resolution satellite images from low- resolution satellite images.

Data Preparation and Exploration:

Collect a dataset of low-resolution satellite images and (if available) matching high-resolution ground truth images.

Model Development and Training:

Select and build a suitable super-resolution model to

enhance low-resolution images.

Model Evaluation and Optimization:

Test the model on a separate validation set of low-resolution images and analyze its performance. Participants should also experiment with different optimization techniques to improve resolution accuracy.
